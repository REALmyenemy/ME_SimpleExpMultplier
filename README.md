A simple plugin so actors get different exp varying conditions. Can be used as a core.

This is a default behavior you could just change by editing ex params mid game with a few variables.
A developer can manage variables as they want so each char takes different stuff into consideration, stuff like money, walk steps,
char level, class, luck, status... and each character one or many of these!
There's endless ways to consider this, so you can control it with a parallel proccess common event to make the calculations into a
new variable, then set it, use it as a increase or lower exp rate.
The problem is that rpg maker editor allows you to set exp rate up to a cap. Any plugin about exp can bypass it.
Also, if you mean to add or retrieve an ammount from the player, you can use the plugin command "ME_SEM Add X Y" to give (or take if - if below 0) X multiplied by their rate to actor Y.

I'm not so sure I will actually develop this plugin. There's too many development costs for too little benefit.
